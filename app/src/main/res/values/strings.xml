    <string name="large_text">Most web pages are written in a combination of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). In short, HTML specifies the content and logical structure of the page, while the CSS specifies how it looks: its colors, fonts, formatting, layout, and styling.

CSS flex-box layout is a particular way to specify the layout of HTML pages.

One of the most defining features of the flex layout is its ability to form-fit, based on its viewing environment. Flex boxes can adjust in sizeâ€”either decreasing, to avoid unnecessarily monopolizing space, or increasing to make room for contents to be constrained within its boundaries. Moreover, the flex layout is less restrictive in terms of content flow than those, for example, of the block and inline display types, which are generally uni-directional. The flex directional flow can be specified as rightwards, leftwards, upwards, or downwards. Individual items within a flex container may also be automatically reordered and rearranged to suit the available layout space.[3]</string>
